We would require `R` and `R Studio` for the session. Remember that `R Studio` doesn't work without `R`. You would need to download both of these softwares. 

**Download and Install:**
1.  [**R download**](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/) 
2.  [**R Studio Download**](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download) 
3.  **Run the below R codes to install and load libraries in your R studio**

```r
# you would need to install only once
install.packages("tidyverse")
install.packages("readxl")

# post installation run these commands
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
```

**Read and Watch:** 

4. [**Read R Foundations Syllabus**](https://github.com/vkoul/jcpR/blob/master/Resources/R_Foundations_Syllabus.pdf)  
5. [**Watch: What is R?**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XcBLEVknqvY): A very good introductory video on R.

1. **[R For Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/)**: This book is a great introduction to `R` and covers the components of the [`Data Science pipeline`](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/introduction.html) which we discussed in the session. 

2. **[Hands-On Programming with R](https://rstudio-education.github.io/hopr/)**: This covers the programmatic aspects of the `R` language and would help you to be really clear with the basics. 

3. **[Cookbook for R](http://www.cookbook-r.com)** The goal of the cookbook is to provide solutions to common tasks and problems in analyzing data. Most of the code in these pages can be copied and pasted into the R command window if you want to see them in action.

1. **The Analytics Edge** course either on [OCW](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/sloan-school-of-management/15-071-the-analytics-edge-spring-2017/index.htm) or [edx](https://edx.org/course/the-analytics-edge). Please check the assignments tab. They have provided the data for each assignment. You can readily check your answers on their website. 

  * Some of these assignments would expect you to know more than what was covered in class, so make extensive use of Google. This is a proper Masters level course taught at MIT in their Business Analytics program, so expect it to be challenging but you will definitely learn a lot if you are able to finish the assignments. 

2. **[In-house test](http://rpubs.com/cbatra/500620)**: This is a pre-requiste to attend the R-Intermediate class. Mail me for the datasets to be used. 

3. **[Revision Quiz](http://rpubs.com/koulvi/revisionquiz)**: Based on Part 1 of R Foundations
